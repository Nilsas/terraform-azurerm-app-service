## Information

This document contains the risk assessment for the Azure App Service Plan as it is being delivered through the CCoE.

| Area | Description |
|--|--|
| Application Type | PaaS |
| Application Criticality | High |
| Application Data Sensitivity | High |
| Regulatory Requirements | GDPR,<br/>ISO27001,<br/>CIS 1.1.0,<br/>NIST SP 800-53 R4,<br/>NIST SP 800-171 R2 |

## Risk Assessment

|Vulnerability | Existing Controls | Severity
|--|--|--|
| Authentication | Access for the resource and the apps hosted on it are separated. An RBAC access policy permission model is enabled. <br/> Azure AD authentication is available for the Web App | Medium |
| Access | Access to the secrets can be restricted by selected networks and limited user roles | Medium |
| Security Logging | Diagnostic logs are enabled on each Web App and sent to a storage account | High |
| Data Encryption at rest |Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest, where the Web App files are stored. Dependent on Storage Account component. More details in the Storage Account component documentation. | High |
| Data Encryption in Motion | TLS 1.2 is always enforced on an App Service Web App level | High |
| Network protection | Application whitelisting and filtering is available for each Web App | None |
| Disaster Recovery| Deployments of App Service Plan are region-bound. Multi-region availability of function and web apps is part of a larger solution | Low |
| Business Continuity | The App Service plan is highly available within a single Azure region, providing the same level of availability to the Web Apps | Low |
| Regulatory Compliance GDPR | Platform Enforcement of Asset Creation in EU Regions (defaults to West Europe (NL)) | High |
| Regulatory Compliance ISO27001:2013 | All Policies for ISO Compliance are applied (as a subset of the CSP) | High |
| Regulatory Compliance CIS 1.1.0 | All Policies for CIS v1.1 Compliance are applied (as a subset of the CSP) | High |
| Regulatory Compliance NIST SP 800-53 R4 | All Policies for NIST SP 800-53 R4 are applied (as a subset of the CSP) | High |
| Regulatory Compliance NIST SP 800-171 R2 | All Policies for NIST SP 800-171 R2 are applied (as a subset of the CSP) | High |
